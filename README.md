Complete with a puppeteer backend and electron frontend.

Written ~Summer 2021, designed to automatically sign up for google accounts using a puppeteer headless browser, and provide sms-verification if neccesary.

As this is OLD code which is based on a earlier version of the Google sign up page, success can't be guarranteed.

One of my first pupeteer projects, and therefore is not written with best practises or to my current standard, if you're looking for a newer puppeteer project with better written code. I'm uploading something in the near future.

Enjoy  one of my longer developed progenies which accompanied me for many late nights during the Summer of '21.

p.s. I believe the license key login is still in effect on the executable, feel free to fork and remove the login or contact me or log an issue if you are interested and I can remove it.
